    <h1> 3d-printing</h1>
    <img src="T1RnoOT.png">
    <p>A lot of things can be 3d printed today. From toys to industrial tools, or even houses.
    3d printing has become very popular to all sorts of hobbyists. It is fun, cool, and can be used in a lot of fields.
    To understand to awesomeness of the 3d printer, you must know how it works. Basically the 3d printer is made in a cartesian style.
    This means that there is an x-axis, y-axis, and z-axis. Each axis has a motor that controls the movement of the axis, thus 
    moving the nozzle. The nozzle is where the filament (which is like the paper in a regular printer) comes out of.
    It becomes very heated in the nozzle (reaching temperatures of 300 degrees celsius). After that the filament is compressed
    onto the heatbed. It keeps layering the filament in a specific pattern until the shape you want has been made. The brains
    behind this whole operation is the microcontroller that heats the extruder nozzle and heatbed, controls the movement
    of the motors and controls the led screen (optional).</p>
